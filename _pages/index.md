## About Us

**Stamatics** is the student society under the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, IIT Kanpur. Throughout the year, we organise various mathematical competitions, talks by various professors and students, workshops, and numerous other informal and formal sessions to guide students towards a fruitful life in the campus and outside. We also runs a Math blog on Medium, aimed at shedding light and inculcating interest in Mathematics. 

In a nutshell, Stamatics is a group of individuals who strive to put all the opportunities, interesting researches, fun puzzles and the guidance of seniors, out in the open for everyone in the campus.
